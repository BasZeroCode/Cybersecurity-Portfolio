Scenario

As a security professional, it’s important to understand the concept of communicating with your computer via the shell.

In this scenario, you have to input a specified string of text that you want the shell to return as output. You'll also need to input a few mathematical calculations so the OS (operating system) can return the result.

Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll use the echo command to generate some output in the shell. Second, you’ll use the expr command to perform basic mathematical calculations. Next, you’ll use the clear command to clear the Bash shell window. Finally, you’ll have an opportunity to explore the echo and expr commands further.

Generate output with the echo command

echo hello 

output 
hello

Run the command with quotation marks

echo "hello"

output
hello

Output your name

echo "Bas"

output 
Bas


Generate output wiith the expr command

expr 32 -8

output 
24

Calculate average number of logic attempts per year

expr 3500 * 12

output 
42000

Clear the shell

clear
