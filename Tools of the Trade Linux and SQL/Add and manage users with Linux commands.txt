Scenario

In this scenario, a new employee with the username researcher9 joins an organization. You have to add them to the system and continue to manage their access during their time with the organization.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll add a new employee to the system and then to their primary group. Second, you’ll make this employee the owner of a file related to a particular project. Third, you’ll add the new employee to a supplementary group. Finally, you’ll delete the employee from the system.
