Scenario

Your role as a security analyst requires that you have the Suricata and tcpdump network security applications installed on your system.

In this scenario, you have to install, uninstall, and reinstall these applications on your Linux Bash shell. You also need to confirm that you’ve installed them correctly.

Here’s how you'll do this: First, you’ll confirm that APT is installed on your Linux Bash shell. Next, you’ll use APT to install the Suricata application and confirm that it is installed. Then, you’ll uninstall the Suricata application and confirm this as well. Next, you’ll install the tcpdump application and list the applications currently installed. Finally, you’ll reinstall the Suricata application and confirm that both applications are installed.


apt 

sudo apt install suricata

Note: To install and uninstall software in Linux, it's necessary to use elevated privileges. Therefore, prefix the apt install and apt remove commands with sudo.

Additionally, please be aware that the installation of the Suricata application might take a few minutes to complete.

When utilizing APT to install an application, the output lists all software to be installed, including necessary additional components known as dependencies. These dependencies are essential for the proper functioning of the main application. APT efficiently manages the installation of both the application and its dependencies.

suricata

sudo apt remove suricata


Suricata, a network analysis tool used for intrusion detection
tcpdump application. This is a command-line tool that can be used to capture network traffic in a Linux Bash shell

sudo apt install tcpdump

apt list --installed
