Scenario

In this scenario, you have to find more information about commands that you need to use. You also need to discover which command to use to perform a certain task.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll explore a few commands you can use in the shell to learn more about other commands. Next, you’ll find an option you need to add to a command. Third, you’ll use a command to get a brief description of commands so you can identify their differences. Finally, you’ll identify the command you need to perform a task.

USERADD(8)                  System Management Commands                 USERADD(8)

NAME
       useradd - create a new user or update default new user information

SYNOPSIS
       useradd [options] LOGIN

       useradd -D

       useradd -D [options]

DESCRIPTION
       useradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian, administrators
       should usually use adduser(8) instead.

       When invoked without the -D option, the useradd command creates a new user
       account using the values specified on the command line plus the default
       values from the system. Depending on command line options, the useradd
       command will update system files and may also create the new user's home
       directory and copy initial files.

       By default, a group will also be created for the new user (see -g, -N, -U,
       and USERGROUPS_ENAB).

OPTIONS
       The options which apply to the useradd command are:

       -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
           The default base directory for the system if -d HOME_DIR is not
           specified.  BASE_DIR is concatenated with the account name to define
           the home directory. If the -m option is not used, BASE_DIR must exist.

           If this option is not specified, useradd will use the base directory

NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each speci-
       fied file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are  more  than
       three  files  or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given, then rm prompts the
       user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the response is
       not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise,  if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the
       -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or  --interactive=always  op-
       tion is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the
       response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing
              recursively;  less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection
              against most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i); without
              WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when  removing  a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is
              on a file system different from that of the  corresponding  command
              line argument

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root[=all]
              do  not  remove  '/' (default); with 'all', reject any command line
              argument on a separate device from its parent

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the  --recursive  (-r  or
       -R)  option  to  remove  each listed directory, too, along with all of its
       contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one
       of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover
       some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater
       assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.

RM(1)                             User Commands                             RM(1)

NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each speci-
       fied file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are  more  than
       three  files  or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given, then rm prompts the
       user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the response is
       not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise,  if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the
       -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or  --interactive=always  op-
       tion is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the
       response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing
              recursively;  less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection
              against most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i); without
              WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when  removing  a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is
              on a file system different from that of the  corresponding  command
              line argument

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root[=all]
              do  not  remove  '/' (default); with 'all', reject any command line
              argument on a separate device from its parent

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the  --recursive  (-r  or
       -R)  option  to  remove  each listed directory, too, along with all of its
       contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one
       of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover
       some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater
       assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.
