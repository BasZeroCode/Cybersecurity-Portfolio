Decrypt an encrypted message

Task 1. Read the contents of a file

analyst@ee727feeda06:~$ ls
Q1.encrypted  README.txt  caesar
analyst@ee727feeda06:~$ cat README.txt
Hello,
All of your data has been encrypted. To recover your data, you will need to solve a cipher. To get started look for a hidden file in the caesar subdirectory.

Task 2. Find a hidden file

analyst@ee727feeda06:~$ cd caesar

analyst@ee727feeda06:~/caesar$ ls -a
.  ..  .leftShift3

analyst@ee727feeda06:~/caesar$ cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"
In order to recover your files you will need to enter the following command:

Task 3. Decrypt a file

analyst@ee727feeda06:~$ openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute

analyst@ee727feeda06:~/caesar$ cd ~

analyst@ee727feeda06:~$ openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute

analyst@ee727feeda06:~$ ls
Q1.encrypted  Q1.recovered  README.txt  caesar

analyst@ee727feeda06:~$ cat Q1.recovered

If you are able to read this, then you have successfully decrypted the classic cipher text. You recovered the encryption key that was used to encrypt this file. Great work!
