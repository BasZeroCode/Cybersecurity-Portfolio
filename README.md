Below are the projects I worked on during my Google Cyber Security course.

Google Cybersecurity Program Portfolio:

Welcome to my portfolio, a testament to my immersive journey within the Google Cybersecurity Program. This compilation encapsulates a spectrum of hands-on activities, intricate lab exercises, and impactful projects designed to mirror the multifaceted responsibilities of Entry-Level Security Analysts. Throughout this portfolio, my focus has been on refining and applying key skills crucial for success in the dynamic field of cybersecurity:

# NIST Framework Proficiency:
I have cultivated a proficiency in applying the NIST Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) alongside a nuanced understanding of the CIA triad. This equips me to adeptly address and mitigate security incidents.

# SIEM Tools Mastery:
Adept use of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, including Wireshark and tcpdump, has empowered me with the skills needed for comprehensive network packet analysis and proactive threat identification.

# Linux Command Line Competence:
I demonstrate skillful navigation of the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), essential for tasks such as file management and user authenticationâ€”critical components of effective security administration.

# Access Control Strategy Implementation:
My experiences include the practical application of access control strategies to analyze and proactively mitigate potential security incidents. This strategic approach contributes to the establishment of a robust security posture.

# Incident Handling Proficiency:
Proficient use of an Incident Handler Journal showcases my methodical approach to incident handling, ensuring precise incident tracking and facilitating timely and appropriate responses.

# Python Programming for Automation:
Leveraging Python programming, I have automated various security tasks, enhancing operational efficiency and demonstrating a commitment to staying at the forefront of cybersecurity operations.

# Closing Note:
Embarking on the Google Cybersecurity Program has not only sharpened my technical prowess but has also deepened my understanding of the challenges in the cybersecurity landscape. Beyond technical skills, the program has provided me with a holistic perspective on collaborative problem-solving and the ability to thrive in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.

This portfolio stands as evidence of my unwavering commitment to advancing my knowledge and skills in the cybersecurity domain. The experiences gained during the Google Cybersecurity Program underscore my practical readiness and commitment to continuous professional development.
