**Botium Toys Cybersecurity Project Overview**

*Phase 1: Laying the Groundwork*

I led a cybersecurity project for Botium Toys, a growing U.S. toy company expanding online. The project aimed to address concerns about business continuity, compliance, and security risks tied to the company's growth.

*Audit Scope and Goals:*

Worked with the IT manager to set clear goals:

**Scope:**
- Checked everything: physical and digital assets, online operations, and EU compliance.

**Goals:**
- Checked how secure things are now.
- Identified risks and vulnerabilities.
- Looked at compliance with U.S. and EU rules.
- Gave recommendations for expanding the IT department.

**Risk Assessment:**

Found and ranked risks to critical stuff, business operations, and sticking to the rules. This guided where we focused in the audit.

*Phase 2: Checking Controls and Compliance*

**Checking Controls:**

Looked at how well the security measures were working:

- Who can get in?
- How safe is the network?
- What about keeping data safe?
- Ready for if something goes wrong?
- Are people trained to be careful?

**Checking Compliance:**

Made a checklist based on EU and U.S. payment rules. Found where things didn't match up and gave ways to fix them.

*What We Said and Wrote Down:*

Put everything into a clear report. It showed Botium Toys how to improve security, follow rules, and write down what to do.

**Results:**

Made Botium Toys safer and helped the IT team grow. Followed a solid plan, found and fixed risks, and made sure Botium Toys followed the rules. All the details are in my GitHub portfolio. It shows how good I am at checking and fixing things for businesses.
