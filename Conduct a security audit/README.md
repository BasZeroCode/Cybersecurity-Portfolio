**Botium Toys Cybersecurity Project Overview**

*Phase 1: Setting the Foundation*

Undertook a comprehensive cybersecurity project independently to conduct an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a growing U.S.-based toy company expanding its online presence. The project was initiated due to concerns about business continuity, compliance, and security risks associated with the company's growth.

**Audit Scope and Goals:**

**Scope:**
- Covered entire IT infrastructure, including physical and digital assets, online operations, and compliance with EU regulations.

**Goals:**
- Assessed current security posture.
- Identified and documented risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Evaluated compliance with U.S. and EU payment processing regulations.
- Provided findings and recommendations for potential IT improvements.

**Risk Assessment:**

Independently conducted a comprehensive risk assessment to identify and prioritize potential risks to critical assets, business continuity, and compliance. Guided the focus areas of the audit.

*Phase 2: Controls Assessment and Compliance Checklist*

**Controls Assessment:**

Independently evaluated the effectiveness of existing security controls by:

- Analyzing access controls and authentication methods.
- Reviewing network security measures.
- Assessing data protection practices.
- Evaluating incident response procedures.
- Examining employee training and awareness programs.

**Compliance Checklist:**

Developed a detailed compliance checklist independently based on GDPR and U.S. payment processing requirements. Identified areas of non-compliance and provided actionable recommendations for improvement.

**Recommendations and Documentation:**

Compiled findings and recommendations independently into a comprehensive report, serving as a guide for potential enhancements to Botium Toys' security posture, compliance, and documentation.

**Project Impact:**

This independent project not only contributed to enhancing Botium Toys' security and compliance but also demonstrated the ability to work autonomously in cybersecurity auditing, risk assessment, and compliance management. The detailed documentation is available in my GitHub portfolio, showcasing expertise and commitment to securing digital environments for businesses.
